Project code for Machine Learning for Functional Genomics course at Columbia University

two files are too large to upload directly to git. Download them from these google drive links directly:

**ENCFF690FNR.bed.gz**, which contains methylation data for loci in the genome
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c_oTFgF7mzB6KfIzh8TJ8t9smBoG1GvV/view?usp=sharing

The data is described here: https://www.encodeproject.org/documents/964e2676-d0be-4b5d-aeec-f4f02310b221/@@download/attachment/WGBS%20pipeline%20overview.pdf

**hg38-002.pkl.zip**, which contains nuclei located at each loci in human genome (2013 sequencing):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QAUnQgW38F0qfrsjN2DUhUSxgJTbP9ru/view?usp=sharing



The remaining two data files are described below:

**genes.tsv** contains each gene on every chromosome with start and end loci

**ENCFF292KIL.tsv**  contains TPM data for genes
